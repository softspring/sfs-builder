## Why SFS Builder
Design layouts with simple or complex block structures and reuse them on different pages or sections. 

Create pages by combining modules you create yourself or using the ones we provide. 

For common sections on different pages, simplify creation with our reusable block concept. 

Manage multiple versions of the same page and preview the changes without fear of making mistakes, publish the final version when you are happy with it! 

All this with a semantic website from the first block, responsive, multi-site, multi-language and SEO ready.
